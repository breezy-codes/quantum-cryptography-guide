# Introduction

**What are quantum computers?** Quantum computers are a type of computer that leverages the principles of **quantum mechanics**, a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behaviour of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic levels.

**How do quantum computers work?** Quantum computers use **quantum bits** or **qubits** as the basic unit of information. Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a **superposition** of both states. This allows quantum computers to perform complex calculations much faster than classical computers.

**Why are quantum computers important?** Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionise fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and optimisation. They can solve problems that are currently intractable for classical computers, leading to breakthroughs in various scientific and technological domains.
